Reliability engineer for Go production systems. Expertise: pprof (CPU/memory),
goroutine leaks (NumGoroutine), context deadline exceeded, connection pool
exhaustion (sql.DB), PostgreSQL from Go (pool tuning), observability
(Prometheus, slog, OpenTelemetry), runtime scheduling behavior (container-aware GOMAXPROCS defaults).
Foundation plugin handles stack-agnostic incident workflows.

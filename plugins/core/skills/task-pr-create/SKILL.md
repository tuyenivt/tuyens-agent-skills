# PR Description Generator

## Purpose

Turn a git diff into a complete, reviewer-ready pull request description in one command:

- **Title** - concise, imperative, under 72 characters
- **Summary** - what changed and why (not how)
- **Risk classification** - helps reviewers calibrate attention
- **Test plan** - what to verify before merging
- **Linked context** - tickets, ADRs, related PRs surfaced from commit messages and CLAUDE.md

This skill writes the PR description. It does not open or submit the PR.

## When to Use

- After finishing a feature, fix, or refactor branch and before opening the PR
- When you want a consistent, complete PR description without writing it manually
- When the diff is large and you need a clear summary to orient reviewers

## Inputs

| Input                    | Required | Source                                                        |
| ------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Git diff or file list    | Yes      | `git diff main...HEAD` or paste diff directly                 |
| Commit messages          | Yes      | `git log main...HEAD --oneline`                               |
| Ticket / issue reference | No       | Branch name, commit message, or user-provided (e.g. JIRA-123) |
| ADR references           | No       | Mentioned in commit messages or `docs/adr/` directory         |
| Related PRs              | No       | User-provided or referenced in commit messages                |

If no diff is provided, run `git diff main...HEAD` to obtain it. If the base branch is not `main`, ask the user for the base branch before proceeding.

## Workflow

### Step 1 - Detect Stack

Use skill: `stack-detect` to identify language, framework, and tooling. This informs test plan language (e.g., "run `./gradlew test`" vs `pytest` vs `go test ./...`).

### Step 2 - Gather Context

Run or ask for:

1. **Diff**: `git diff main...HEAD` (or supplied by user)
2. **Commits**: `git log main...HEAD --oneline --no-merges`
3. **Branch name**: `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
4. **Changed files**: `git diff main...HEAD --name-only`

Extract from the above:

- **Ticket references**: patterns like `PROJ-123`, `#123`, `closes #`, `fixes #`, `resolves #` in branch name or commit messages
- **ADR references**: mentions of `ADR-`, `adr/`, or `docs/decisions/` in commits or diff
- **Related PRs**: mentions of `PR #`, `pull/`, or sibling branch names in commits

### Step 3 - Classify Risk

Use skill: `pr-risk-analysis`

Produce a single-line risk output:

```
Risk: Low | Medium | High | Critical  -  [1-2 sentence rationale]
```

This appears verbatim in the PR description to orient reviewers immediately.

### Step 4 - Write PR Description

Compose the description following the Output Format below.

**Title rules:**

- Imperative mood: "Add", "Fix", "Refactor", "Remove", "Update" - not "Added" or "Adding"
- Under 72 characters
- No ticket number in the title (goes in the body)
- Format: `<type>: <what changed>` where type is one of: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `perf`, `chore`, `docs`, `test`

**Summary rules:**

- Explain the _why_ (motivation, problem being solved) more than the _what_ (code mechanics)
- 3-5 bullet points; each starts with a verb
- Do not re-describe the diff line by line
- Reference the ticket/ADR inline if it provides essential context

**Test Plan rules:**

- Concrete, runnable steps - not "test it works"
- Include the exact test command for the detected stack
- Add manual verification steps for UI/API changes
- Add migration steps if a DB migration is included

**Checklist rules:**

- Only include items relevant to this specific PR
- Skip items that don't apply (don't list empty boxes for non-applicable items)

### Step 5 - Surface Linked Context

At the bottom of the PR description, add a **Linked Context** section only if at least one of the following exists:

- A ticket reference was found → link as `Closes PROJ-123` / `Ref #123`
- An ADR reference was found → link by title if resolvable, otherwise by path
- A related PR was found → reference by number or branch name

If nothing was found, omit the section entirely - do not add empty placeholders.

## Output Format

```markdown
## [type]: [concise imperative title under 72 chars]

### Summary

- [Why this change was needed / what problem it solves]
- [What changed at a high level - domain, layer, component]
- [Any notable design decision or trade-off made]

### Risk

**[Low | Medium | High | Critical]** - [1-2 sentence rationale based on change signals]

### Test Plan

- [ ] Run tests: `[stack-appropriate test command]`
- [ ] [Manual verification step 1 - e.g., "Call POST /api/v1/orders and verify 201 response"]
- [ ] [Manual verification step 2 - e.g., "Check that existing orders are unaffected"]
- [ ] [Migration step if applicable - e.g., "Run `./gradlew flywayMigrate` on staging before deploying"]

### Checklist

- [ ] Tests added or updated for new behaviour
- [ ] No secrets, tokens, or PII introduced
- [ ] Migration is reversible (if applicable)
- [ ] Breaking API changes are documented (if applicable)

### Linked Context

Closes [TICKET-ID](link-if-available)
ADR: [ADR title or path]
Related: #[PR number or branch]
```

### Output Constraints

- Title is the first line with `##` prefix - not a separate field
- Risk always appears before Test Plan - it frames reviewer attention
- Omit any section that has no content (e.g., omit Linked Context if nothing found)
- Do not include implementation details visible in the diff - orient reviewers, don't duplicate the diff
- Test plan must include at least one runnable command for the detected stack
- Keep total PR description under 400 words - reviewers read it, not file it

## Rules

- Never invent ticket IDs or ADR titles that don't appear in the git context
- If the diff is empty or the branch has no commits ahead of base, say so and stop
- If the diff is too large to summarize meaningfully (500+ files), ask the user to scope the input
- Do not include personal opinions about code quality - this is documentation, not review
- Risk classification from Step 3 must be the only risk assessment - do not add a second one inline

## Key Skills Reference

- Use skill: `stack-detect` for test command and ecosystem language
- Use skill: `pr-risk-analysis` for risk classification from diff signals

## Success Criteria

A well-generated PR description passes all of these. Use as a self-check before presenting the description.

### Completeness

- [ ] Title is imperative, under 72 characters, and uses a valid type prefix
- [ ] Summary explains the _why_ (motivation) - not a re-description of the diff
- [ ] Risk classification appears before the test plan and includes a rationale
- [ ] Test plan contains at least one runnable command for the detected stack
- [ ] Checklist items are specific to this PR - no inapplicable empty boxes

### Accuracy

- [ ] No ticket IDs, ADR titles, or PR references were invented - all from git context
- [ ] Risk classification uses pr-risk-analysis signals - not gut feel
- [ ] Linked Context section is omitted if no references were found in git context
- [ ] Total description is under 400 words - concise enough for reviewers to read, not file

### Staff-Level Signal (for tech lead review)

- [ ] A reviewer can determine Approve / Request Changes from the Summary and Risk alone
- [ ] High or Critical risk PRs have a rationale that explains the specific system impact
- [ ] Migration steps are included in the test plan if a DB migration is in the diff
- [ ] The description orients reviewers to what matters - it does not duplicate the diff

## Avoid

- Titles that start with "This PR..." or are longer than 72 characters
- Summaries that re-describe the diff ("Changed X.java to add method Y") instead of explaining motivation
- Test plans with vague steps ("verify it works", "test manually")
- Invented or placeholder ticket/ADR references
- Including the Linked Context section when nothing was found in git context
- Recommending the user submit or push - this skill only writes the description
